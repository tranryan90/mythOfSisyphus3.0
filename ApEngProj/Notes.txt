So always pull before you do anything to make sure you are up to date 
and when you are done make sure you push and if you have any errors 
just comment them out for yourself. When you make a change make sure to commit 
and see what changes you do before you sync it. 
And last tip is if you do work on one of the classes that 
Im working on make sure to tell me as to not run into errors.
